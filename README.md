# Smart Process Analytics on Business Process Intelligence Challenge (BPIC) 2013 Open Problems
 BPIC 2013 ,created by Ward Steeman, consists of Volvo IT Belgiumâ€™s log with events from an incident and problem management system called VINST. In that log, there are both open and closed problems. We are given the open problems dataset. Its main aim is to provide a customer with his/her normal service operation as fast as possible when an issue arises. Preprocessing is done using python, and the data analysis is done using the process mining tools Disco and PROM.
